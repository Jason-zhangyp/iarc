The OSU Robotics Club Aerial Team was formed in 2009 with the goal of competing in the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC). The IARC is an annual collegiate autonomous aerial robotics competition. The competition attempts to further the state of the art in aerial robotics by posing challenges that are not yet possible using current technology.

In Winter 2010, the Aerial Team was re-established with entirely new team members and an entirely new dual rotor design. The new team has the same goal of competing in the IARC along with new goals such as competing in the SparkFun Autonomous Vehicle Competition.
