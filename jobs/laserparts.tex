\section{Find parts for Laser Grid}
\subsection{Overview}
There is a bill of materials for the laser grid part of the IARC mission 6
competition located somewhere on the International Aerial Robotics Competition
webstie. I would be helpful in ordering these parts to list links to suppliers
of these parts. Formulate a list with links to part suppliers along with
quantities to order, sorting the list by supplier (ie, parts from digikey, then
mcmaster etc.).\\
Forward the email to Daniel Miller once completed and parts will be ordered
shortly.
