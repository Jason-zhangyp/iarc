\section{Testing ESC Response}
\subsection{Overview}
The three phase motor controllers (esc's) are typically designed for hobby
applications other than quad rotors (like RC cars). These other applications
involve motors being geared down, so the firmware gradually ramps up motor
speeds to avoid stripping the gears. This spin up time is detrimental to
quad rotor function.\\
Some of the ESCs we have may already be configured for quad rotor use, test
the different ESC's using the arm setup to confirm which ESCs work best
(correct fastest ).
\subsection{Electrical}
The inertial measurement unit will need to be secured tightly to the arm facing
towards the motor. Each ESC will need to be soldered to the 11.1V connection.
Other components can be more flexibly mounted with 5V and Ground connections.
\subsection{Software}
Software for these tests is completed and ready in the esctest folder under
testing in the the software folder, the y and h keys can be used to change
the numerator of the gyro correction and u and j for the denominator. Do not
divide by zero.
