\section{Backup Flight Control}
\subsection{Overview}
In order to ensure flight control is achieved, it seems prudent to purchase
a ready to operate flight control system. So far, the ardupilot seems like
a good choice. Find out what parts go together to be able to hover (main board,
sonar sensors, etc). It may also be helpful to clarify in the rules whether
GPS and magnetometers are allowed, as they are options.\\
Send links of these parts to Daniel Miller, and if your ambitious, call a
supplier such as DIY drones to see if shipping can be expedited to get the
boards here as soon as possible (to ensure flight by the end of the term).
\subsection{Findings}
GPS is not allowed in competition, magnetometers are ok.\\
Should order a sonar sensors.\\
