The International Aerial Robotics Competition: Mission 6 is an annual robotics competition held until a team successfully completes all of the mission objectives satisfactorily. The current mission involves taking off with an autonomous flight platform, finding a meter square window on a representation of a building, navigation the building to find an office where a flash drive is kept in an in box on a desk, retrieving the flash drive and exiting the building.
For the competition not all intelligence needs to be mounted on the flight platform itself and much computing is usually done by a wirelessly connected computer.
