Part of the mission involves retrieving a flash drive. Initially it was planned to try and use something like an auto-grabber to pick it up. However, it was pointed out that the dexterity and depth perception required to do so is a lot to expect from an average person, much less an autonomous flying contratpion.
John Hart came up with the idea to have two wheels rotating towards the center to 'suck up' any objects about the size of the flash drive. He made a prototype out of his sons erector set which performed extremely well, capable of consistantly picking up flash drives at any orientation to the rotary pickup device while hanging from a string.
A second prototype is currently being refined to be assembled.
