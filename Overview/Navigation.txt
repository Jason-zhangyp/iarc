In order to navigate automounsly, an array of infrared (IR) distance sensors rotation on servos will be used as a kind of makeshift LIDAR to identify the surroundings. Operating the IR sensors will take little computing power and can be used to identify nearby obstacles to be avoided, and recognize important landmarks like tables, corners, windows, and doors.
To accomplish these goals we will be using an array of 3 of these sensors, mounted on servos to provide 180 degrees horizontally towards either side of the flight platform and the 180 degrees vertically in front to provide height information as well.
In the future we plan to implement computer vision to identify signs and other clues in the building, but this will not be a priority until stable navigation of the flight platform using IR sensors is accomplished.
